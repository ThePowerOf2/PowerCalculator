# PowerCalculator
A python module that takes in 2 paramaters (Number , Power) and prints out the result!

## Theoretical Numbers

Max output = [MAX ARRAY SIZE = 536,870,912] * [MAX NUM IN ARRAY = 999999999] = 5.368709115×10¹⁷ Digit Number.
Max Number that can be used = SquareRoot(999,999,999,999,999,999) = 1,000,000,000.
Max Power = ?.
