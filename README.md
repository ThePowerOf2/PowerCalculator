# PowerCalculator
A python module that takes in 2 paramaters (Number , Power) and prints out the result!

## Theoretical Numbers

Max output = [MAX ARRAY SIZE = 536,870,912] * [MAX NUM IN ARRAY = 9] = 4831838208 Digit Number.  
Max Number that can be used = SquareRoot(999,999,999,999,999,999) = 1,000,000,000.  
Max Power = ?.  
**_I say Theoretical as i don't have the computer power to reach these numbers nor do i have an in depth knowledge of the real limits of python. But i'm very happy to get feedback and corrections on my equations!_**
