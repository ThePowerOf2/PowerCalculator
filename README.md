# PowerCalculator
A python program that has 2 modules 'Big_Power(x,y)' and 'Print_Power(z)'.  
The first module takes in 2 integers x and y. x = Number that is going to be used. y = Power to use on x. It returns an Array of the Result.  
The Second module takes in the array that was formed in the First Module and the prints it out into an acctual number.  

### Theoretical Numbers

Max output = [MAX ARRAY SIZE = 536,870,912] * [MAX NUM IN ARRAY = 9] = 4831838208 Digit Number.  
Max Number that can be used = SquareRoot(999,999,999,999,999,999) = 1,000,000,000.  
Max Power = ?.  
**_I say Theoretical as i don't have the computer power to reach these numbers nor do i have an in depth knowledge of the real limits of python. But i'm very happy to get feedback and corrections on my equations!_**
